## Purpose and Responsible Use Statement

The **BSky Campaign Tool** is designed to support democratic communication by enabling transparent, responsible, and evidence-based engagement in digital spaces. The open-source nature of this project aims to foster collaboration, innovation, and a digitally literate civil society.

This project is committed to strengthening an informed public sphere, where communication is grounded in accuracy, accountability, and respect.

## Core Principles

1. **Support for Democratic Processes**
   The tool is intended to empower actors who seek to strengthen democratic participation, public dialogue, and civic education.

2. **Evidence-Based Communication**
   Users are encouraged to prioritize verifiable information, transparent sources, and fact-checking practices.

3. **Media Literacy and Public Awareness**
   The project aims to contribute to a digital environment where individuals and organizations can critically assess information, understand the dynamics of online communication, and recognize manipulative strategies.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**
   Automated communication should always remain comprehensible, traceable, and aligned with ethical standards.

5. **Safeguards Against Manipulation**
   The project rejects the strategic use of digital tools for disinformation, synthetic amplification, deceptive automation, or intentional distortion of public discourse.

## Misuse and Ethical Concerns

Although the **MIT License** permits unrestricted use of the software, the maintainers explicitly state that the following types of usage are **not aligned with the purpose or values** of this project:

* Creating or amplifying **disinformation**, misleading narratives, or intentionally false claims.
* Manipulating public debate through **covert automation**, **inauthentic identities**, **opaque message boosting**, or other deceptive techniques.
* Deploying the tool in ways that reduce media literacy, obstruct fact-checking efforts, or undermine public understanding.
* Using automated communication to erode trust in democratic processes, independent journalism, scientific evidence, or civic institutions.

These uses are not legally forbidden under the license, but they conflict with the ethical foundation and intended societal purpose of the software.

## Community Expectations

Contributors and users are expected to:

* Apply the tool in ways that enhance understanding, trust, and factual accuracy in digital communication.
* Support fact-checking, contextualization, and transparent presentation of information.
* Remain mindful of the impact automated messaging can have on public perception.
* Publicly identify misuse or ethical concerns when they become known.
* Contribute to improving the tool in ways that promote media literacy and counter manipulative practices.

The maintainers may publicly distance the project from forks, deployments, or campaigns that violate these principles.
